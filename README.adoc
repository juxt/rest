== Introduction

This README contains a step-by-step guide will help you code a standard
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[REST]ful Web
service.

This means it will satisfy the minium requirements laid down by RFCs
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231[7231],
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7232[7232],
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7233[7233],
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7234[7234] and
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235[7235].

Mention how you should strive not to follow this procedure for every endpoint,
but establish resource metadata which can influence processing and make your
handlers far more reusable and generic.

== Step-by-step Guide

[[check-service-available]]
=== Is the service available?

. Check that your service is not overwhelmed with requests.

. If it is, construct a `503 (Service Unavailable)` response and go to
<<error-response>>. Otherwise, go to <<check-known-method>>.

NOTE: How you can tell this is beyond the scope of this guide. It might be a feature
of the web listener you are working with. Or you might want to build something
that signals that new web requests should temporarily suspended. If you don't
know, just skip this section, it's optional.

[[check-known-method]]
=== Check method is known

The next step is to check whether the request method is one your system
recognises.

. Check if the *request method* is recognised, for _any_ resource. If not,
construct a 501 `(Not Implemented)` response and go to <<error-response>>.

include::{includedir}/check-known-method.adoc[]

=== Locate the resource

[quote,Section 2 RFC 7231]
____
The target of an HTTP request is called a "resource".
____

The request contains the Uniform Resource Locator (URL), which as its name
suggests, is used to locate the target resource.

But first, what _is_ a resource? A resource can be anything! But for our
purposes, we define a *resource* to be a _value_ (e.g. object, structure,
entity, class instance in our programming language).

This value should include a set of *request method* tokens that indicate the
request methods allowed on the resource.

It can also include any other attributes of the resource that may be useful
later on (for example, for authorization or method execution).

////
The set of *request method* tokens might very well depend on details in the
request. For example, a resource might allow a POST but only if the request is
_authorized_ to do so. So you can make use of any information in the request,
not just the URL, to determine the set of *request method* tokens
allowed. Moreover, if some attribute or attributes of a resource are referred to
in making such a decision, or affect the processing of request methods (at the
minimum, the *request method* in the current request), then these should be
included in the *resource* too.
////

. Construct the *resource* structure that corresponds to the *URL path* in the
*request*, using any other information in the request as necessary. If no
*resource* corresponds with the path, construct a NULL resource.
+
TIP: Try to avoid using the *request method* when locating a resource--a
*resource* value should encompass _all_ its methods.

include::{includedir}/locate-resource.adoc[]

=== Authorize the request

Now's the time to authorize the request, to ensure the request has the authority
to interact, with the method in the request, on the resource you have located.

Often, this will involve inspecting some data about the resource.

If no authorization is necessary, skip this section.

NOTE: Authorizing the request may involve some validation, e.g. of the
`Authorization` header. This might yield a 400 or other error response.

==== Authenticate the request

If you decide that the request needs to be authorized, the request must contain
the necessary credentials.

These might be provided in the form of an `Authorization` header, by a cookie or
by some other means.

If there are credentials provided in the request, then you should respond with a
401 error response.

Depending on the means of authentication, you might also want to add a
`WWW-Authenticate` header or some else to indicate to the user agent that it
should resend the request with credentials.

Go to <<error-response>> for how to send an error response.

This can be done by inspecting the request
headers, in particular, the `Authorization` header and establishing any claims
made are true (i.e. they can be trusted). This might involve verifying digital
signatures or performing a query on a database containing sessions.

Such claims and session information can be attached to the request. How you
should do this is up to you and your programming language.

=== Validate the request with respect to the resource

Return 400 if the request is not valid

==== Validate parameters (OpenAPI)

=== Check method allowed

Return a 405 if the method is not allowed on the resource, with an Allow header

[[select-representation]]
=== Select the representation

If the *request method* token is `GET` or `HEAD`, we must now select the
*representation* (or *representations*) for the *resource*.

Otherwise (if the *request method* token is _not_ `GET` or `HEAD`), then _skip
to the next section_.

A *representation* consists of a set of *representation metadata* and sufficient
additional information to produce a *stream of representation data*.

For the given *resource*, determine the content negotiation strategy and follow
one of the sections below (although it is permissable to use a hybrid or
combination of strategies).

TIP: If in doubt, use <<proactive-content-negotiation,proactive content negotiation>>, which is by far the most
commonly strategy.

* <<proactive-content-negotiation>>
* <<reactive-content-negotiation>>

[[proactive-content-negotiation]]
==== Proactive Content Negotiation

1. Determine the set of available *representations* for the resource.

2. If step 1. yields no representations, return a `404 (Not Found)` error
response. Go to <<error-response>>.

3. Select the most acceptable representation from this set, using the preferences contained in the request. If one exists, we'll use this one - _go to the next section_.

4. If step 3. yields no such acceptable representation, return a `406 (Not
Acceptable)` error response. Go to <<error-response>>.  Construct a body
containing links to each unacceptable representation from step 1.

include::{includedir}/proactive-content-negotiation.adoc[]

[[reactive-content-negotiation]]
==== Reactive Content Negotiation

1. Determine the set of available *representations* for the resource.

2. If step 1. yields no representations, return a 404 error response. Go to <<error-response>>.

3. Optionally, filter this set using the preferences contained in the request.

4. If step 3. yields a single representation, then use this as the representation and _move on to the next section_.

5. If step 3. yields multiple *representations*, respond with a 300 response and construct a body containing links to each representation in this filtered set.

////
Return the representation, with validator header fields, payload semantics and
control data (see 7.1, control data).
////

=== Record the time

We are now close to generating the response.

1. Get the current time and store it ready for generating the `Date` response header.

NOTE: Some servers add the `Date` header for you.

=== Check not modified

If the *request method* token is `GET` or `HEAD`, we will have selected the
*representation* for the *resource*, in section <<select-representation>>.

We must now check to see if any *preconditions* in the request, when compared
with corresponding *validators* that exist in the *representation metadata*,
prior to proceeding.

// TODO: Explain algorithm here, but first improve the existing spin algo
because it's not aligned well enough to 7232.

=== Process the *request method*

Go to the relevant procedure below, corresponding to the request method.

. <<get>>
. <<post>>
. <<put>>
. <<delete>>
. <<patch>>
. <<options>>

[[get]]
=== GET (or HEAD)

NOTE: The procedure for HEAD is identical to that of GET, with the exception
that we do not produce any body in the response.


[[post]]
=== POST

[[put]]
=== PUT

[[delete]]
=== DELETE

[[patch]]
=== PATCH

[[options]]
=== OPTIONS


[[error-response]]
=== Send an error response

If you want to send an error response, you should decide whether to send a body
in the response. This might contain information about the error and explain to
the user-agent (or human) how to avoid the error in future.

. Perform content negotiation to establish the best representation to send.

. Add the *representation metadata* to the response headers, and stream the
*representation data* as the the *body* of the response.

// mode: outline
// outline-regexp: "[=]+"
// eval: (local-set-key (kbd "<M-up>") 'outline-move-subtree-up)
// eval: (local-set-key (kbd "<M-down>") 'outline-move-subtree-down)
// End:
